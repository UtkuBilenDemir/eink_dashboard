This is a dashboard I am trying to display on a 7.5 inch e-ink monitor connected to a raspberry pi 4. 

Current roadmap:

- [x] Display productivity times sourced from toggl
	- [ ] Find a better way to compute the best days and weeks
- [ ] Parse daily todos from the obsidian vault
- [ ] Calendar implementation
